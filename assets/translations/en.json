We understand that everyone learns differently, and no one should be forced to follow a single way of learning.\nFrom that experience, Study Whiz AI was born as a smart study assistant that stays by your side, helping you understand lessons in the way that suits you best.\nNot to do the work for you, but to turn hard problems into opportunities to learn smarter.",

  "faq": {
    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "q1": "Does Study Whiz AI solve all exercises for you?",
    "a1": "No. Study Whiz AI is designed to support your learning process. When you enter an exercise, the AI system analyzes the question, suggests possible solution approaches, explains each step, and provides reference answers when available. The main goal is to help you understand the underlying concepts and problem-solving methods, so you can apply them independently to similar exercises.",
    "q2": "Is using Study Whiz AI to do homework considered cheating?",
    "a2": "If you use Study Whiz AI as a learning tool to understand problem-solving methods, review your work, or explore new approaches that is a proper and legitimate use. However, if you copy the results generated by Study Whiz AI and submit them as your own work, especially in exams, assessments, or graded assignments, it may be considered academic misconduct under your school’s regulations.",
    "q3": "Are my problem data saved or shared?",
    "a3": "We may store parts of your query history and problem content to improve responses, helping the system learn and assist you better. This information is anonymized and encrypted, and is not stored with personally identifiable data unless necessary.",
    "q4": "Does Study Whiz AI guarantee that all answers are always accurate?",
    "a4": "No AI system can achieve 100% accuracy. The answers and explanations provided by the application are intended for support and reference purposes only and may contain errors or non-optimal solutions. You should use these results as a reference to compare, verify, and learn alongside your own work or official study materials.",
    "q5": "Can I use the app during exams?",
    "a5": "No. Study Whiz AI must not be used during exams, tests, or any form of official assessment without permission from your school or instructor. The purpose of the application is to help you learn and strengthen your knowledge, not to provide “answers for you” in testing situations."
